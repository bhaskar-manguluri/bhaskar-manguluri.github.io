How much time do you estimate (his question is typical college freshman) reading the notes and effectively learning : The Answers in the lecture were 5 mins, 25 kins, hours, 5.5 hours, 6 hours by medical students: But for me this is a histogram with maximums at around 3 hours and median around 15 -30 mins, mean around same saying that my max hours are very few in number also. But mean will definetely be higher than medain. Do I feel happy that this is the case now. nope . when jeremy teaches I could go on to may be 4 hours too, when there is a system issue(which will add with little enthu and lot of confidence that answer is up in the google searches, this fixing of issue takes away never encounters the narrow hope of solving the bounding boxes from gradcam in an hour kind of things, enthu is proportiional to my perception of how capable I am to do that and when I comnpare with the recent gradcam task both has the similarity that I dont know how to do both could begoogled and learned, yet in gradcam thing I feel there are many less people capable of doing it and I naturally find that I dont believe that it could be solved in half an hour and 1 hour and I generally postposne thos  )
