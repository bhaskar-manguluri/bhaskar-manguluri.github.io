How much time do you estimate (his question is typical college freshman) reading the notes and effectively learning : The Answers in the lecture were 5 mins, 25 kins, hours, 5.5 hours, 6 hours by medical students: But for me this is a histogram with maximums at around 3 hours and median around 15 -30 mins, mean around same saying that my max hours are very few in number also. But mean will definetely be higher than medain. Do I feel happy that this is the case now. nope . when jeremy teaches I could go on to may be 4 hours too, when there is a system issue(which will add with little enthu and lot of confidence that answer is up in the google searches, this fixing of issue takes away never encounters the narrow hope of solving the bounding boxes from gradcam in an hour kind of things, enthu is proportiional to my perception of how capable I am to do that and when I comnpare with the recent gradcam task both has the similarity that I dont know how to do both could begoogled and learned, yet in gradcam thing I feel there are many less people capable of doing it and I naturally find that I dont believe that it could be solved in half an hour and 1 hour and I generally postposne thos  )

Storybof his girl froemnd who will fully studied for 6 hours where her concentration reduced after 20 mins so sghe didnt study

Psychology101 is that : things that are punished are ignored, things that are reinforced are learned better. for his girlfriend after that 30 mins rest iof 5:30 hours is punishing herself

fi\rst rule: Mon\ment when we shovel across time , take a break. For half an hour you need not recharge for half an hour for most people 5 mins would do. so he advices study half an hour and take a break. if she followe d this for 6 hours she would have studied for 5:30 mins. After each cycle just enjoy something in a break will a guitar break suit me 

After the big time done , plan something speacial. he has racism of for most women with kids , go to bathroom tub and I will kill you if someone enters as mon\ms dont have time. For boys he says its not PC but he enjoys beer. compares tghe storty of his friend where he reads by 7Pm and then go to happy hours and enjoys beer where his friends start at 3 and plan to study at exhausted time of 7. This kind of reinforcement helps to increase the initil capacity of maybe half an hour to some hours so it will be ghelpful for difficult tasks

Next question is about Where does one study: Do you have study room? reading in kitchen etc.. little desk that he comes at night and reads stuff. Some  suggestions are driving to library , cofe shop etc. And then some solid advice is like having a study lamp on and switch to study and then stop it zone out etc.. you have to think which suits you

He is like how bed roomn cant be study room as bed room has its own primary functions which primes us to distractions

he is like for students 1 grade point more for people who simply have a study area. 

1. break study into small chunks and reinforce it 
2. create a study area
3. more active you are in study more you learn
4. expand the notes immediately after class, That may just take 5 mins 
5. Survey chapter , raise questions and answer things. 

Discussing point 3, wrote memory might work. for many memorise and repeat, rote learning is effective but distinguishing concept and fact is better way of learning. Asshole sugmund fraud is teh father of psychoanalysis this is a fact, what is psychoanalysis this is concept . So facts are memorised or related to some easy pneumonics and remember, these days we have google also so not much effort is required to memorise the facts.But we have to grasp concepts. I think I am doing this from childhood

Looks like my time is right now a little above20 mins lets see how I will change this 

Some experiments on how much rememberance is there with people who understands vs who remebers 

One things that I have experienced many times , that higlighting when studyin gfor first time then yiou most probably wont study at all and just highlight things. So what he says is recognising and remembering, it should not be just recognisingand say I saw this vs predicting what comes next.sop active learning helps. So his advice is like read a page and next page and then look up in the sky try to say whats there on the prev prev page, I havetried this not as a fixed strategy but very effective although I dont make this into habit as I  never studied continously

ONe thing I realised after sometime is I lose My effectiveness in writing notes for this as I start losing the feeling of importance for this lecture, I felt its repititive after some point. and obvious too. That graph from flow is more interesting in this concept. When thongs loose the challenge vs skill no flow so when I feel his talk is no more challenging for my skill itsnot engaging



Consolidation actuallly happens in REM. Best adcice he says is slleping more, ALert mary lovers do you get REm sleep at all?

When there uis overlap likeaffected and effected then brain struggles alot. 

Best way to learn is teaching someone else so recitation can improve what you8 learn. Jupyter is awesome whenever we can use that jusrt use that is what I feel

Mneumonics to remember facts. Flavors of mneumanics acronyms, coined saying, interacting images(technically taking notes also). 

survey chapter, raise questios and answe


Then taking notes. Ideally after each class sit down with the notes and then expand that. if you donafter 2 hours not right after then you mmight forgot
