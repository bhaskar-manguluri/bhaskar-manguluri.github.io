After Pilonidal sinus surgery and break, Sam gave me this one. This is the last leacture of a proffessor before he dies , he has cancer in his liver and its hard
for him. Exited to see my writing journey kickstart with this lecture

**When there is a elephant in the room introduce them**. For a native telugu speaker this felt like if there is a bigshot in room introduce them. But it is this "that there is an obvious problem or difficult situation that people do not want to talk about.". Mr Boobsy did this once, He was a open book in one of the most uncomfortable or I should say a topic that no oine discusses publicly was discussed. I should may be get inspired by him, but I still maintain to be the closet guy. 
Funny that Randy talks about this by saying that his father taught him. My father Taught that not everyone I interact with neeed to know everything, somethings are better unsaid. He gave this advise when he saw me smoking cigarette outside Akshaya Udipi in Rajamundry. that I need not say anything to mother and its all cool. I ended up telling to sister now cause she wasn't handling her love shit together and I thought I should say this and similarly I said to suresh cause again my sister wasn't able to hab\ndle the shit effectively and may be as he interacts more with her he could put that into her sense. Nut yeah I will still say when it is not an elephant just don't introduce and let me drink milk like a cat who closes the eyes and assummes no body is watching it

Randy is clearly not depressed and was energetic, he says we cannot change the cards that we are dealt and we just need to play the hand. he even takes pushups to prove he is healthy, I think pulling out unexpected is a good type of humour it might not be laughing out hard but it will be remembered and appreciated

**cognitive dissonance** great thing, many people should be having these experiences. He says he is more healthy now and it is one of the case of cognitive dissonance we will see and then the above mentioned pushups. I had these many times in life may be another time when I'm nostalgic and eating memberberries

He has wife and kids and he says in this lecture he is not talking about things that are bigger than his childhood dreams,and mentions them and he is not strong enough to speak about them without tearing up. I think that is the case, will Iever feel that anytime, does my mother or father come into that?, I think my dogs will definitely come into that, and so are my friends. But recently I have realised I would love romance with a girl and I would like to have that relationship with one I like. Given how unattactive I am to female eyes I think thats hard to find, I should say to myself good luck with that

Outline of the Talk
1. Randy's child hood dreams
2. Enabling dreams of others: As you get older enabling dreams of others is also more fun . I always am in it and I used to have enthusiasm in teaching people on it.
3. lessons learned 

This is epic, he had a childhood dream of playing football. he had coach Graham who came to the first class without football ( still disappointed the american football is called football especially since the follow up is on fundamentals). When one of the students say you dont have football his reply was that *how many player in team? 22, how many people has ball? 1 we are practsing what the other 21 guys are doing* . A very good lesson to get that its all about fundamentals. you have to get your fundamentals right. yeah you have to be. wherever I am good in lefe its not because I put very good effort and became master in it, I am yet to get that feeling in any field I touched upon and am good in it, but where I am bad I am bad at fundamentals(lets say drawing, dancing, sharing on instagram(huh time to give up that, its a useless platform which reinforced by small attention span and gives me a illusion that problem is somewhere else). but the epic which the para started isthat this coach used to make him do pushups grind him after practise and another coach gave the epic statement that *it's good , its good that he is grilling you, cause if you screw up and no body is saying anything then that means they gave up* . If you are doing things wrong and no body is saying anything then that is a bad place to be in. Takeway: Fundamentals,critics loves you, work hard and enthusiasm,head fake learnings(you learn teamwork etc with football). "Experience is what you get when you dont get what you want" (open banana feed if my older self becomes dumb enough to not get this is , otherwise its achievement not experience. well gain achievements can have experience but..)

Disney Imagineer Dream: Gave him a go fuck yourself letter. But this is epic "The brick walls is a good thing, brick walls are there to show you how badly you need it, brick walls are there for other people"

If you are pissed of at people , give them enough time and they will surprise and impress you. I dont know about this but just kept it here if my future self find its worth noting

when the Deam wormer argues that its IP and going to someone change the clause, he sees that its a pissing match. Its very important to know that you are in a pissing match you should quickly get out of it 

one at a time is not efficient. well hell yes

A chance to show people what it feels like to make other people excited . by performing a VR show in this case. How can I make have this feeling(i would have written experienced, this guys great quote on it is makibng me not write)
