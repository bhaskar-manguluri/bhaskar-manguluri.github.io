[Pix2Pix](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix) , very popular for image to image translation, should see how much data is required for normal images.Another to look at is the problem of aspect ratio changes when trying to resize every image to same shape, We should crop to similar shape and take centre crop to resize so that we maintain aspect ratio. Fastai does something very close to this 
[a repo with curated pytorch links](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN),. All the other links may get reduntant :). But good to have both.
[DCGAN](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow) This is a tensorflow impementation, this repo has a link for pytorch implementation. This was tghree years back and very beginning and I dont think we can get any SOTA. But looking at readme I feel this is a must learning experience
[PIX2PIXHD](https://github.com/NVIDIA/pix2pixHD) is is pix to pix for HD Images. Is the input dimensiohn of PIX to PIX small and cannot be changed? Why do we need to have two pix2PIX for HD and normal can't one kind of architecture support any shape? HD can also be limited by HD resolution, so we need to have resolution independent PIX2PIX?No? . These people has a editing interface as well
[DeepNude](https://github.com/yuanxiaosc/DeepNude-an-Image-to-Image-technology) a dangerous application here, but understanding this can improve the practical knoweledge required for GANS
[One more GAN curated collection](https://github.com/nashory/gans-awesome-applications)is guy goe s by application like super resolution, image to image, style transfer  
[sketch based 3d object generator](https://github.com/maxorange/pix2vox) not for reaL images,may useful for understanding. less priority or more research paper
[another dangerous resource](https://github.com/shaoanlu/faceswap-GAN) very interesting though. they are using different angles to come at good data preparation
[uinsupervised image to image transalation](https://github.com/mingyuliutw/UNIT) if the claimn of there results is true then peace beacause it is unsupervised may be we save so much of tagging efort
[automatic facial animation from a single image](https://github.com/albertpumarola/GANimation) They show results on game of thrones characters, seems like they have so much training data, coulodnt get what the claim of single image is here.
[impersonator](https://github.com/svip-lab/impersonator) very recent paper novel view synthesis and what not
[one implementation of cycle gan and pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) this is pytorch based
[ pytorch GAN collection implentation](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN) Great they implemented many papers
[cycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN)his or pix2pix ? which is better, or wehich is easier to have fun. best difference is 
[HE made repo for learning GANS](https://github.com/YadiraF/GAN) There are some comments on the performances like faster than a classifier, may be very interesting to know and reproduce. As this is a learning source its better you do it first or exhaustion of out of the box good performance papaers. Again as this is learning its all MNIST
[Photorealistic style transfer oh and FastPhotoStyle ,how fast](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FastPhotoStyle/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md) fast Phiotostyle, it concentrates on photo realistic style transfer as opposed to artistic style transfer. The repo[https://github.com/NVIDIA/FastPhotoStyle]
